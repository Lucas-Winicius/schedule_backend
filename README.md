# **Schedule Backend**

> Greetings! Today, I bring you the first part (backend) of my schedule project. I came up with this idea during my course project, which utilized the full MVC pattern. Based on it, I decided to split it into two projects, this one being the backend, and the other being the frontend that will consume this API. üòä <br/> - Lucas Winicius

This is the backend part of my schedule project and this is a brief usage documentation. I hope you like it. üòò

## **Installation guide**

### Cloning the repository and installing dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lucas-Winicius/schedule_backend.git

cd schedule_backend
```

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
yarn
```

```bash
pnpm install
```

Now that the project is installed along with the extensions, let's take a look at what to do next. <br/>

- Create a `.env` file in the root directory following the `.env.template` standards.
- To execute, use the command:

```bash
npm start
```

```bash
yarn start
```

```bash
pnpm start
```

With everything ready, let's take a look at the available routes.
